# Dodge_lane
A plane fighter game similar to chicken invaders,which is also able to be controlled using voice commands

## voice_control
we used the MFCC features of a dataset that we downloaded, and we trained both an mlp and a cnn model,which had accuracies of around 92% and 96%
then we saved this model and opened it in the game so that it can be controlled using your voice.

## game
we used pygames to creat a game similar to chicken invaders or any arcade plane shooter game.
you can use the arrow keys to move, and you can also use space to shoot bullets.
the game also has a database that stores all the highscores.
